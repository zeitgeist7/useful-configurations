- Open the Tools>Build System menu and select “new build system”
- Name it Node, and a new file called node.sublime-build will be created.
- Add the following data to it and save:

{
    "cmd": ["node", "$file", "$file_base_name"],
	"working_dir": "${project_path:${folder}}",
	"selector": "*.js"
}

- Might need a restart of Sublime Text
- Select Node as the build system
